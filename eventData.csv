1792,1802,French Revolution,Napoleonic Wars,"<p>The French Revolution caused significant political and social upheaval, not just to French but to substantial proportion of Europe. With many countries directly involved, and others being indirectly influenced. The Revolution began due to the dissimilation of academic ideas that disapproved of the political system of France at the time. In addition, to food shortages the dissimilation of these ideas amongst the 'commoners' provided a population in France that was not content with the political situation. Therefore, when a rise of taxes was considered, the resulting debacle displayed to the people of France the inefficiency and unfairness of the system. As explained by Alpha History, ""what started as a dispute over proposed tax reforms in 1787-88 soon morphed into a movement for political and constitutional change. ""<span class=""super"">1</span></p><p>However, what makes the French Revolution significant is that it was a direct movement away from the old hierarchal political system towards experimentations towards others, which eventually led to the dominance of capitalism and democracy amongst most western countries.<span class=""super"">2</span> While, the neighbouring countries surrounding France were outraged by the violence occurring within the country, the radical ideas continued to spread throughout Europe as observed by Rapport.<span class=""super"">3</span> Nevertheless, despite the violence and chaos caused by the French Revolution, the people did not achieve their goal, as they still ended up with a monarchy, with Napoleon as their head. Who would shortly lead the country into a conquering expedition, a few months afterwards. </p> If you would like a quick rundown of the French Revolution, watch this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEZqarUnVpo"">video </a></p>","<span class=""super"">1</span> alphahistory.

However, these battles even reached as far as Russia and Egypt, with the final crippling battle happening in Britain. Additionally, it has been argued amongst historians about the influence the Napoleonic Wars had upon America, who are believed to have taken advantage of the wars economically.<span class=""super"">2</span> These wars also marked the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and of Prussia. Furthermore, there are arguments that these wars were the birth of modern warfare. Warfare that would later become iconic of the World Wars. This was because, for one, ""the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars were the first national wars in which combatants were drawn directly from civilian society"".<span class=""super"">3</span>  Secondly there are also debates concerning whether these wars had the characteristics of 'Total War'. A concept that would not enter ""popular usage until the final stages of World War One"". <span class=""super"">4</span>  Vere provides an intriguing exploration of Bell's argument surrounding the potential influence of the Napoleonic Wars and their influence upon later wars, and modern warfare. <span class=""super"">5</span> Whether these arguments and debates on the broader themes of the Napoleonic wars do or do not convince you, it cannot be denied that the Napoleonic Wars had a far-reaching affect and influence both in its own time period and those stretching beyond it.

1812/06/18,1815/02/17,War of 1812,Continental Blockade,"<p>The war of 1812 was a conflict primarily between America and Britain. It was caused through tension resulting from Britain's 'Orders in Council' which were a retaliation against Napoleon's Continental Blockade. What these policies did was restrict America's ability to trade as freely as it would like and allowed Britain to impose taxes on American trading ships.  In addition to this, Britain had been taking American sailors to man the war in Europe. Both countries still disagree about the heritage of these sailors, with Britain claiming they only took British dissenters who were pretending to be American. These tensions with Britain were also influenced by colonial aspirations, with America interested in sections close to the Canadian border and parts of South America.</p><p>This was an event that developed due to the influence of events happening within other parts of the world, and yet its resulting impact would measure more heavily upon their neighbour Canada, than themselves. With Pierre arguing that Canada were the true winners of the War of 1812. <span class=""super"">1</span> As ""Canada owes its present shape to negotiations that grew out of the peace, while the war itself - or the myths created by the war - gave Canadians their first sense of community and laid the foundation for their future nationhood. ""<span class=""super"">2</span>. America itself did not achieve any of the goals it set out to achieve from this war.</p>","<span class=""super"">1</span>Berton, Pierre, and James Marsh.
